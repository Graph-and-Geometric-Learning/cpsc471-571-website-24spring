                                    size will be taken under consideration when evaluating the scope of the project in

                                <li>Undergraduate: We expect new GNNs on at least 2 large-scale datasets. If you are
                                    reproducing GNNs that are already open source, we expect an in-depth analysis
                                    (comparison, ablation, visualization, interpretation, explainability, autoML). If
                                    implementing complex GNNs from scratch, we will not require analysis</li>
                                <li>Graduate: We require an in-depth analysis of GNNs. We will hold graduate student
                                    projects to a higher level of novelty in algorithms/architectures on at least 2
                                    datasets. If you implement off-the-shelf GNNs, you must devise new modifications or
                                    try out different tasks and objectives.</li>
                                <li>The Project is an important part of the class and it will be very beneficial if you
                                    aim to work on research in this area.</li>
